## Alison Woodman

I've spent the past 16-weeks learning to code at Makers Academy, a highly selective and intensive dev bootcamp in London. Before this I managed a charitable trust with a £2M annual turnover for the Centre for Effective Altruism, a Y Combinator backed non-profit who apply science and evidence to improve the world. Noticing the value of technical skills in my role there, I decided to take on a new challenge and learn to code. I look forward to leveraging my skills in a fast-paced, collaborative environment where I can continue to rapidly improve as a developer.

#### Ability and desire to learn

I have an inquisitive mindset and am proactive about learning new things. I self-taught Maths AS in school, achieving an A. 12 weeks at Makers Academy has been an exciting experience involving building a completely new set of skills. I actively sought out challenges such as learning Node.js to build an Airbnb clone in a week, and making an AR mobile game using Unity and C# as my final project.

#### Self-reliance

I'm capable of assuming responsibility and working independently on novel problems. Within the first two months at my previous organisation I was entrusted with managing a charitable trust. For two and a half years I was responsible for all aspects of running it, from compliance to financial oversight to donor and beneficiary communications. In this time the Trust disbursed over £4M to effective charities.

#### Communication

As Director of Community I was in charge of a group of 2000 members of the charity. I acted as point of contact for queries about membership or the charity more generally, and organised several events to celebrate community milestones. I held over 400 Skype conversations to welcome and onboard new members during the course of two and a half years.

#### Teamwork

I enjoy working in a group toward a shared goal. I joined a conference team as the Speaker Liaison for Effective Altruism Global San Francisco 2016, a conference attended by 1000 guests and 100 speakers. I worked in an intensive environment to a strict deadline managing a group of 12 volunteers and regularly checked in with the team to ensure a successful event.
