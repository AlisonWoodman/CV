## Alison Woodman

I'm currently learning to code at Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive dev bootcamp in London. Before I started coding I managed a charitable trust with a £2M annual turnover for the Centre for Effective Altruism, a Y Combinator backed non-profit dedicated to applying science and evidence to improve the world. I look forward to leveraging my skills in a fast-paced, collaborative environment where I can continue to rapidly improve as a developer.
