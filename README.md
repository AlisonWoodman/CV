## Alison Woodman

Learning to code at Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive dev bootcamp in London. Before I started coding I managed a charitable trust with a £2M annual turnover for the Centre for Effective Altruism, a Y Combinator backed non-profit applying science and evidence to improve the world. I look forward to leveraging my skills in a fast-paced, collaborative environment where I can continue to rapidly improve as a developer.

## Skills

#### Ability and desire to learn

Have an inquisitive mindset and am proactive about learning new things. Self-taught Maths AS in school, achieving an A. 12 weeks at Makers Academy has been an exciting experience involving building a completely new set of skills. Enjoyed the fairly hands-off teaching approach which gave freedom to explore frameworks such as Node.js and xxx in group projects.

#### Self-reliance

Capable of assuming responsibility and working independently on novel areas. Within first two months at previous organisation was entrusted with managing a Charitable Trust. Was responsible for all aspects of running it, from compliance to financial oversight to donor and beneficiary communications. Over two years responsible for disbursing over £4M to effective charities.

#### Communication

As Director of Community was in charge of a group of 2000 'members'. Acted as point of contact for queries about membership or the charity more generally, and organised several events to celebrate community milestones. Had over 400 Skype conversations to welcome and onboard new members over the course of two and a half years.

#### Teamwork

Enjoy working in teams towards shared goals. Joined a conference team as the Speaker Liaison for Effective Altruism Global San Francisco 2016, a conference attended by 1000 guests and 100 speakers. Worked to a strict deadline managing a group of 12 volunteers and regularly checked in with the team to ensure a successful event.
